 <h1>About Us</h1>
 <br>
 <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From
  the
  coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then
  roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine
  particles
  that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

  Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
  caffeine
  content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and presented in a variety of
  ways
  (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although
  chilled
  or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance
  the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment
  that
  sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling
  cannabis).

  Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy
  adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of
  the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.[5]

  The earliest credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day
  Yemen
  from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner
  similar to current methods.[2] The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali
  intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North
  Africa, later spreading to Europe.

  The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70
  countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa.
  As
  of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total.[6] Coffee is a major export
  commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous countries.[7] It is one of the most valuable
  commodities
  exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is the most traded agricultural commodity and the most
  traded
  commodity overall, second only to petroleum.[8] Despite the sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars, those
  actually
  producing the beans are disproportionately living in poverty.[9] Critics also point to the coffee industry's negative
  impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. The environmental costs and wage
  disparity of farmers are causing the market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand.</p>
