 <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>

 <p style="width:50%">
  Coffee is consumed worldwide – the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many
  different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different
  from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and
  strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences
  between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting
  coffee.</p>

 <p style="width:50%">
  The term French Roast describes the color of the bean after it has been roasted and is traditionally the darkest on
  the
  scale of roasts. French roasted coffee tends to have a dark chocolate color, with a smokey, rich flavor.</p>

 <h2>Columbian Roast</h2>
 <img src="./images/columbian roast.jpeg" width="300" height="250" alt="columbian Roast">
 <p style="width:50%">Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the world; the plants thrive under
  the shade of banana
  trees in the tropical climate. Because of Colombia’s high altitude, it also shapes the way the bean grows.


  While the country produces a crazy amount of coffee, it actually exports a lot of its best beans. While going to
  Colombia for your next brew is an awesome idea, you can also get your hands on the beans and brew them at home!
